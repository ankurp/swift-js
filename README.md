# swift.js [Work in Progress]

Swift to JS Transpiler

# Install

`npm install swift-js`

# Usage

* Run `./node_modules/.bin/swift-js ./Test.swift`
* It will generate `Test.swift.js` file and output in same directory as `Test.swift`

# Issues

This is very early stage and needs a lot of work to get all of the code to transpile correctly. Pull Requests are appreciated.
